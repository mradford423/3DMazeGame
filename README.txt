This is our 3D Maze Game.

-Use the WASD keys to move along the axis.

-The icosahedron shaped objects flip your view 180 degrees along the z axis. This makes it appear as if you are walking on the ceiling, and reverses the maze and the controls. 

-Your objective is to navigate through the maze and reach the portal at the end.

Good luck!
